# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Turtle Racing

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A betting game that lets a player bet on winner

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Player will choose turtles (racers) and turtles will race. Winner will be random everytime. Player will bet on turtle.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, NOT applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Turles (racers) based on player's input and calculate space between two turtles on canvas

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Calculation for distace between turtles and padding on left and right from first and last turtle

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Successfully calculate and place turtles based on player's input and show final winner.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Basic math to calculate the distance between two turtles, padding for left and right, imaginary finish line in y-direction. Need to research how to perform this calculations, how to randomize color and turtle at the same time and based on user input.
